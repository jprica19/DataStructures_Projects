CSCI 340 Data Structures Projects

This repository contains a collection of program projects developed for CSCI 340, focusing on the application of data structures and algorithms to real life scenarios. Each project demonstrates the practical use of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, alongside algorithms for sorting, searching, and traversal.

The programs address diverse real world problems, showcasing how efficient data organization and algorithmic strategies can solve challenges in areas like task scheduling, network routing, inventory management, and data analysis. Explore the individual project folders for detailed descriptions and implementations.
